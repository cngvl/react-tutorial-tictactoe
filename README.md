# React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial

This was my first attempt at learning React.js! I started off by following the [offical React.js tutorial documentation](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe). What I aimed to achieve by following this tutorial was to just get an understand of the general concepts of React props, state, components and event handling, without having to fiddle around too much with any setup or styling processes. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools and knowledge:

1. **Node.js and npm:** You should have Node.js installed on your computer, as it comes with npm (Node Package Manager). You can download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

1. **Basic understanding of React:** You don't need to be an expert, but having a basic understanding of React concepts like components and state will be beneficial.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download the repository:**

2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you've cloned or downloaded the project.

3. **Install dependencies:** Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Start the development server:
After installing the dependencies, start the development server with the following command:
```
npm start
```

This will launch the game in your web browser, and you should be able to see the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
